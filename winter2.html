<H1>Winter Landscape in Snow</H1>
<p>The source of Harald Leth's motifs is observation of nature and his immediate environment. The motifs are those which are close at hand: landscapes and sunsets, arrangements and interiors, the fox at the fringe of the wood and the birds in the bushes, portraits and self-portraits, forest workers and the gables of the house next door - and bathers at the beach.</p>
<p>His pictures are not realistic paintings, though. Reality is what unleashes the artistic process. But during the process which was often lengthy, in spite of the small sizes, focus is moved away from the motif to the colours, the rhythm and the textural effect. In this way, Harald Leth's paintings become pictorial interpretations of what he sees and senses.</p>
